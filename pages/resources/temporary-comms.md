Unlicensed wireless tech for temporary comms

For non-emergency communications there are several technologies which
would help communities. Long-range wifi is useful, and TV Whitespace
technology has better performance in the field but is currently in its
infancy. Ben Ward (Love Hz) has experience with TV Whitespace (TVWS)
in  running Flood Network.

LoRa may also be useful for real-time monitoring
as the water recedes, knowing when it's safe to return.
