summary:
  For community recovery planning, visualisation of the state of
  assets is critical. Assets in this context could include community
  spaces (schools, churches, town halls), businesses (food, basics)
  or infrastructure. This is true for coordination of the immediate
  recovery (which assets require attention), and for the ongoing
  recovery. This is especially true for communities which rely heavily
  on the visitor economy, as sending the message "we're open" is critical.
