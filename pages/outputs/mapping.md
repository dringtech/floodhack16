summary:
  The speed and volume of information means that it can be difficult
  to proritise actions during a flood recovery. Approaches to visualising
  information can help flood managers make sense of this information. As much
  of this can be geolocated, mapping can be a powerful visualisation tool.

Many of the topic areas are locatable. Doing so (potentially as layers on a single map) will provide valuable intelligence for flood managers.

- Property ownership (landlords)
- Flood affected areas
- Flood risk areas
- Flood warning areas
- Location of hubs
- Location of key infrastructure - substation, exchanges, bridges
- Watercourses (rivers, culverts, canals, roads!)
- Location of 'the vulnerable' (e.g. nursing homes, sheltered housing)
- Location of key community assets (e.g. schools, community centres, church halls, hospitals, doctors surgeries)
- Flood warden locations
- Key access routes (roads, rail, etc)
- Major repair requirements (e.g. bridges, roads)
- Citizen reported issues

For each, we need to find a data source.
