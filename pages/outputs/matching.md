title: Matching needs to offers

summary:
  Recent experiences show that people want to help, and clearly during
  the aftermath of a flooding event, people need help. There is often a
  problem with the matchmaking between needs and offers, especially
  in the early chaotic days of a flood event. Approaches to managing this
  which account for the constraints that may be prevalent (e.g. loss of power
  or communication) will be of great value.

There are many opportunities to facilitate easier matching of individual needs to offers of assistance:

* Volunteers to community need
* Disaster response supplies to charitable donations
* Equipment (power washers, dehumidifiers, generators, pumps, heaters) to community need
* Transport needs to offers (I need to get to hospital)
* Tip runs
* Household goods to
* Animal welfare (I need to feed my horses)
* Approved trade lists to community need

This could be a 'dating service' style offering.

Some work has been done on this already
