There are many opportunities to facilitate easier matching of individual needs to offers of assistance:

* Volunteers to community need
* Disaster response supplies to charitable donations
* Equipment (power washers, dehumidifiers, generators, pumps, heaters) to community need
* Transport needs to offers (I need to get to hospital)
* Tip runs
* Household goods to
* Animal welfare (I need to feed my horses)
* Approved trade lists to community need

This could be a 'dating service' style offering.

Some work has been done on this already
